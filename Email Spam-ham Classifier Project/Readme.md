ðŸ“§ Email Spam-Ham Classifier Using NLP ðŸ§ âœ¨
The Email Spam-Ham Classifier is a Natural Language Processing (NLP) project designed to identify and classify messages as either Spam or Ham (Not Spam). This project combines data preprocessing, feature extraction, and machine learning to create a robust and efficient classification system.

ðŸŽ¯ Goal
To build a reliable spam detection model that classifies emails and messages, ensuring effective filtering of unwanted content while maintaining accuracy and usability.

ðŸŽ¯ Objectives
Preprocess and clean textual data to extract meaningful features.
Apply advanced NLP techniques for vectorization and representation.
Train and evaluate machine learning models for optimal spam-ham classification.
Deploy the model using Flask and Streamlit for real-world usability.
ðŸ¤” Why This Project?
Spam emails and messages clutter inboxes, waste time, and pose security risks. This project aims to address these issues by providing an automated solution to detect and filter out spam efficiently. It ensures that important communications remain undisturbed while blocking malicious or irrelevant content.

ðŸ’¼ Description
The project is built using NLP techniques and machine learning algorithms to classify email messages into two categories: Spam or Ham. The pipeline includes:

Data Preprocessing:

Removed stopwords, special characters, and unnecessary spaces.
Tokenized and stemmed words for meaningful representation.
Feature Extraction:

Used TF-IDF Vectorization to convert text into numerical features.
Model Training:

Trained models including Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest.
Achieved high accuracy using the Random Forest Classifier.
Deployment:

Deployed using Flask and Streamlit for easy user interaction.
