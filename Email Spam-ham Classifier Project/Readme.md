Spam-ham classification Project 
Developed a NLP model that will classify email or message is spam or ham

labeled spam as 0 and ham as 1

Divided dataset into training and testing

applied tf-idf TfidfVectorizer to vectorize the dataset

Converted dataset objects to integers LabelEncoder technique

Applied various algorithms to model and testedthe model with
LogisticRegression
Decision tree classifier
Random forest classifier
SVC and KNN

All algorithms are working and predicting well but
Random forest classifier and Decision tree classifier algorithms are working with 100% accuracy

Deployed the model in Flask app and streamlit and uploaded code on github
