# Natural-Language-Processing-NLP-
NLP is a branch of artificial intelligence (AI) that enables computers to comprehend, generate &amp; manipulate human language. Helps computers communicate with humans in their own language &amp; scales other language-related tasks. Makes possible for computers to read text, hear speech, interpret it, measure sentiment &amp; determine which parts are important

# Exploring the World of Natural Language Processing (NLP) with Python

Tokenization: Breaking down text into words and sentences, laying the groundwork for deeper analysis. I discovered how effective tokenization can enhance text processing and understanding.

Stemming and Lemmatization: I learned the importance of reducing words to their root forms, which improves the accuracy of text analysis. It’s fascinating how stemming algorithms like Porter and Lancaster can drastically change the outcome, while lemmatization provides more contextual understanding by considering word meanings.

Stopword Removal: By filtering out common words that add little value to the analysis, I was able to focus on the most impactful terms, uncovering hidden insights that might otherwise be overlooked.

Named Entity Recognition (NER): Diving into NER allowed me to identify and categorize key elements in text—such as names, organizations, and locations—giving me a clearer picture of the data's context.

N-grams and Chunking: Exploring bigrams, trigrams, and chunking helped me understand the relationships between words and how they form meaningful phrases, enhancing the model’s ability to analyze text effectively.

Word Cloud Generation: I created visually stunning word clouds that represent word frequency, making it easy to identify trends and patterns in the text data at a glance.
