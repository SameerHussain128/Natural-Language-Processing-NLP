Project Description: Resume Classification for Job Category Prediction
Objective:
The objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can automatically classify resumes into specific job categories based on their content. This classification is intended to assist in streamlining the recruitment process by quickly categorizing incoming resumes according to predefined job roles.

Key Components:
1. Data Collection and Preparation:

* Acquired a dataset of resumes across various job categories.
* Cleaned and preprocessed the text data to remove noise, standardize formats, and prepare it for model training.
  
2. Feature Engineering:

* Utilized Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques such as TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) to transform resume text into numerical features suitable for machine learning models.
* Engineered additional features to capture relevant information from resumes, such as skills, experience levels, and educational background.
  
3. Model Training and Selection:

* Developed and trained a Random Forest Classifier using scikit-learn, chosen for its ability to handle high-dimensional data and provide interpretable results.
* Evaluated various machine learning algorithms and selected Random Forest based on its performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
  
4. Integration with Web Application:

* Developed a web application using Flask, a lightweight Python web framework.
* Integrated the trained model into the Flask app to allow users to input their resumes through a web interface.
Implemented functionalities to preprocess user input, make predictions using the trained model, and display the predicted job category.

5. User Interface and Experience:

* Designed a user-friendly interface with HTML/CSS to enhance usability and visual appeal.
* Incorporated basic styling and an image (logo) to provide a professional look and feel to the web application.
  
6. Deployment and Testing:

* Deployed the Flask application on a local server for testing and development purposes.
* Conducted extensive testing to ensure the application functions correctly, handles edge cases, and provides accurate predictions.
  
Benefits:
* Automation: Automates the initial screening process by categorizing resumes efficiently.
* Efficiency: Saves time for recruiters and hiring managers by quickly identifying suitable candidates for specific job roles.
* Scalability: Can be scaled to handle large volumes of resumes across diverse job categories.
  
Future Enhancements:
* Enhanced NLP Techniques: Explore advanced NLP techniques like word embeddings (e.g., Word2Vec, GloVe) for better feature representation.
* Real-time Updates: Implement a system for continuous learning and updating of the model with new data.
* Integration with HR Systems: Integrate with existing HR management systems for seamless recruitment workflows.
