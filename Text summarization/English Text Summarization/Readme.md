# Text summarization on English paragraph

"In this project, I summarize a random English paragraph. Summarization means reducing the length of the paragraph without losing its content. I have deleted the unnecessary text taken from the long paragraph."

Make paragraph into lower text 

Remove stop words and punctuation

Divide it into sentences and convert into summary

Hence large paragraph converted into short summary
